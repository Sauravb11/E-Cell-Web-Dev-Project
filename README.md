# Ecell Innovation Board

This is a simple website I made using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It is for showing startup ideas on a board.

## What it has

- A search bar (not working yet)
- Dropdown to choose category
- Some cards showing startup names
- A form to submit your own idea (just design, not working)

## Why I made it

This is part of my progress submission. I am still learning and will add more features later.

## What I used

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS (CDN version)

## Note

All the startup names used in this project (like EduSpark, FarmConnect, etc.) were taken from ChatGPT for example purposes.

This is not the final version. I will make it better in the future.
