# Ecell Innovation Board 

This is a basic website I made using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to showcase student startup ideas and is part of my E‑Cell recruitment process .


## What it has

- Search bar to find startups by name or pitch
- Dropdown to filter by category (like Tech, EdTech, etc.)
- Startup cards (name, pitch, category)
- Colored category badges:
  ◦ Blue for EdTech
  ◦ Green for Social
  ◦ Purple for Tech
- Click "View" to see more startup details (email, website)
- Submission form with validation (just front-end, doesn’t save data)
- Contact section with phone, email, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook
- Responsive and mobile-friendly layout


## What I used

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS (CDN version)
- JavaScript 
- Logo image:ecell.png


## Note

- The startup names like EduTech, FarmConnect, and CodeBolt are examples generated using ChatGPT.
- I will improve it with backend and more real features in future versions.
